                  <br>
                  <p>I am an Ear Nose and Throat surgeon in NHS Lothian and an Honorary Clinical Senior Lecturer at Edinburgh University.</p>
                  <br>
                  <p>My background is in ENT surgery, however I chose to specialize in head and neck surgery, for both benign and malignant conditions.  Following standard UK higher surgical training, I completed advanced fellowship training in Guys and St Thomas' Hospital, London and then further super specialised training in one of the world's most highly regarded head and neck cancer hospitals: Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York. </p>
                  <br>
                  <p>During this time I developed an interest in the management of thyroid disease, and completed a PhD in 2013.</p>
                  <br>
                  <p>As well as achieving the highest possible clinical training, I have always been passionate about research.  I am current head and neck cancer lead for NHS Lothian.  I am involved in multi centre studies in head and neck / thyroid surgery. </p>
                  <br>
                  <p>In contrast to most UK doctors I am very active in research both in the UK and on an international front.  I am a recognised world expert in the management of thyroid cancer, having written a PhD on the subject.  I regularly teach and present work on this subject at national and international meetings.  My major interest is in the conservative management of well differentiated thyroid cancer.</p>
                  <br>
                  <p>I have spoken across the UK, Europe and North America on the subject and national and international levels, with special recognition from the Royal Society for Medicine, the British Association of Head and Neck Oncologists, the New York Head and Neck Society, the American Head and Neck Society and the American Thyroid Association.</p>
                  <br>
                  <p>Having completed my training I worked for 2 years in East Kent as an ENT consultant before taking up my current academic position in Edinburgh.</p>
                  <br>
                  <p>My current scope of practice includes not only general adult ENT surgery but thyroid surgery and head and neck surgery.</p>

If your policy has an excess, you will be invoiced by Medserv on our behalf. If self-funding, Medserv will contact you directly with an invoice. Please note that, for many outpatient procedures, there is a second charge made by the hospital for equipment and consumables that will be billed separately.</p>

                  <p class="text-left pt-3">If insured, the payment process will be the same as for outpatient consultations. At your consultation your consultant should have provided you with a treatment code for your surgery. You should get an all-inclusive guide price from the Spire Murrayfield which can be done directly or via their website here. This includes all aspects of your surgery, stay and a follow up appointment. The hospital will organise payment directly.</p>
